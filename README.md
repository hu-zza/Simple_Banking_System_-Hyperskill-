## About  
  
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.
  
## Learning outcomes  
  
In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Java.

## Extra stuff

This project originally use SQLite that you must install first on your PC.
However, I rather used MySQL on my hosted website. So I had to alter the tests.
(You can find them at 'alteredTests' folder.)
